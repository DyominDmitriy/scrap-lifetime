Wells Fargo says consumer loan growth to stay muted or drop this year,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/wells-fargo-says-consumer-loan-growth-to-stay-muted-or-drop-this-year-4089179,"(Corrects typos in paragraphs 2-3, changes conference date to Tuesday from last week in paragraph 6)

NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. consumer loan growth is likely to remain muted for the rest of the year and could potentially slide, Wells Fargo Chief Financial Officer Mike Santomassimo said on Tuesday.
""I wouldn’t expect large growth on the consumer side in any way, potentially even a net decline,"" Santomassimo told investors at a conference. He said it was a bit more difficult to predict growth in commercial loans, given uncertainty over U.S. tariff policies.
Santomassimo spoke days after the Federal Reserve released Wells Fargo from a seven-year, $1.95 trillion cap on its assets imposed as a punishment in the wake of the bank’s fake accounts scandal.
Wells Fargo plans to focus on growing most of its businesses, including credit cards, investment banking, wealth management and commercial banking, CEO Charlie Scharf told Reuters in an interview last week.
Industry leaders have praised the banks for its efforts.
""Wells Fargo went through a long, arduous road to get out of it,"" JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon said at the same conference on Tuesday. ""I think it was grossly unfair for a million different reasons, punishment should fit the crime,"" he said, adding that Wells Fargo has been earning good returns and has ambition.
Dimon has also applauded Scharf, once his protege and a former executive at JPMorgan.
Wells Fargo is also seeing signs of improvement in dealmaking, Santomassimo said.
""We are starting to see a little bit of share growth"" in investment banking, he said. ""We are certainly seeing lots of green shoots in terms of deals that we just wouldn’t have been a part of earlier.""
Dealmaking has slowed this year as U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff and fiscal policies roiled markets, fueling economic uncertainty. Still, bank executives have expressed optimism about a resurgence.

Moelis CEO-designate joins Wall Street in signaling dealmaking rebound after tariff pause,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/moelis-ceodesignate-joins-wall-street-in-signaling-dealmaking-rebound-after-tariff-pause-4089590,"By Manya Saini
(Reuters) -Moelis’ incoming CEO Navid Mahmoodzadegan told investors on Tuesday that he is optimistic about the dealmaking environment, as confidence returns following a pause in April triggered by U.S. tariff threats.
""I’m optimistic. It definitely feels better and better each day ... The announcement in April, I think set us back a little bit in terms of the M&A environment,"" he said at the Morgan Stanley U.S.FinancialsConference.
Investor sentiment soured and stock markets slid after U.S. President Donald Trump’s ""Liberation Day"" tariff threats, stalling risk appetite and slowing deal activity.
Appetite for deals has since returned, with market participants and bankers once again seeing an opening for initial public offerings and signs of a pickup in M&A activity.
""Everywhere I go, people want to transact. They want to lean into transactions, whether it’s companies or private equity firms or capital providers,"" Mahmoodzadegan said. ""We’re seeing our clients push us to launch transactions, even if the environment isn’t crystal clear.""
Earlier this week, Moelis (NYSE:MC) said Ken Moelis would step down as CEO of the investment bank and hand the reins to Mahmoodzadegan, its co-founder and co-president.
The succession marks a major step for the bank, which has been led solely by Ken Moelis since its founding in 2007.
While succession at companies closely tied to founding CEOs can be challenging due to their outsized personal influence, Mahmoodzadegan said it was part of the ""natural evolution of the firm.""
""I think Ken felt that even though he’s fully active and will continue to be fully active with clients going forward ... this was a great opportunity at a great time to give more responsibility, not just to me, but to the next generation of bankers,"" Mahmoodzadegan added.
The bank’s deal pipeline currently is up from April and is as high as ""it’s ever been at the firm, or close to it,"" the CEO-designate said.
The comments echo Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick’s expectation of a strong end of the quarter for the bank as dealmaking and the calendar for equity capital markets are picking up.

National Bank of Canada’s ratings affirmed at ’A+’ by Fitch,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/national-bank-of-canadas-ratings-affirmed-at-a-by-fitch-93CH-4089589,"Investing.com -- Fitch Ratings has affirmed National Bank of Canada (OTC:NTIOF)’s (TSE:NA) Long- and Short-Term Issuer Default Ratings at ’A+’ and ’F1’, respectively, with a Stable outlook. The rating agency also affirmed the bank’s New York Branch’s Short-Term IDR at ’F1’.
The affirmation follows National Bank’s completion of its $5.6 billion acquisition ofCanadian Western Bank(TSX:CWB) on February 3, 2025. Fitch views this acquisition as strategically sound as it will expand the bank’s national footprint, particularly with commercial clients in Ontario and Western Canada.
As Canada’s sixth largest bank, National Bank derives half of its revenues from Quebec, where it maintains approximately 20% deposit market share along with leading positions in SME and corporate lending. The CWB acquisition is expected to accelerate the bank’s pan-Canadian growth strategy by extending full-service banking to CWB’s client base.
National Bank’s risk profile remains stable, reflecting its conservative underwriting practices and diversified commercial loan exposure. The bank’s due diligence found CWB’s underwriting standards to be robust prior to the acquisition.
Like other Canadian peers, National Bank has seen some asset quality deterioration as the economy softened. Gross impaired loans rose to 0.86% in the second quarter of 2025 (excluding CWB) from 0.54% in the same period last year. Including CWB, gross impaired loans reached 0.98%, within the peer mid-range.
The bank’s asset quality benefits from its larger exposure to Quebec, where housing prices and consumer leverage remain below other parts of Canada. Fitch anticipates a short-term cyclical increase in impairments, particularly due to tariff uncertainty impacts on the Canadian economy.
National Bank continues to deliver strong profitability, reporting an operating profitability-to-risk-weighted asset ratio of 3.39% for fiscal year 2024, among the highest in its peer group. While the CWB acquisition is expected to further diversify revenue, short-term profitability might fall below peer ranges due to integration costs.
The bank has increased performing provisions to counter potential tariff impacts. As of the second quarter of 2025, National Bank’s common equity Tier 1 ratio stood at 13.4%, at the top of the peer average.
National Bank’s funding and liquidity remain favorable compared to peers, with loans-to-deposits at 95.9% in the second quarter of 2025, supported by excess liquidity and deposits collected through the bank’s deposit network.
Fitch noted that negative rating pressure could emerge if the bank’s CET1 ratio approaches or falls below 12% on a sustained basis, or if impairments rise above 2% of gross loans on a sustained basis. Upward rating momentum would depend on improved business profile and reduced geographic concentration in Quebec.

Fitch affirms MSCI at ’BBB-’ with stable outlook,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/fitch-affirms-msci-at-bbb-with-stable-outlook-93CH-4089588,"Investing.com -- Fitch Ratings has affirmedMSCI Inc(NYSE:MSCI).’s Long-Term Issuer Default Rating and senior unsecured debt at ’BBB-’ with a Stable Outlook.
The rating agency highlighted MSCI’s excellent operating performance, noting the company delivered double-digit revenue growth in 2024, maintained EBITDA margins above 60%, and generated strong free cash flow conversion. Fitch calculated MSCI’s leverage at 2.5x as of December 31, 2024.
According to Fitch, MSCI benefits from offering mission-critical inputs that integrate tightly into client workflows. This integration has resulted in substantial subscription-based revenue, which accounted for 74% in 2023 and 73% in 2024. Total recurring revenue, including subscriptions, reached 97% in 2024.
The company has maintained consistent client retention rates ranging from 93% to 96% each quarter for over four years, providing high revenue visibility. Fitch expects these metrics to remain relatively consistent, offering strong credit protection.
MSCI’s business maintains one of the highest-margin profiles among data and analytic processing companies in Fitch’s coverage universe. The company’s EBITDA margin was slightly above 63% in 2023 and expanded to 63.4% in 2024, continuing a multi-year trend of consistent margin expansion.
Capital intensity was slightly higher in 2024 at 4% of revenue, which Fitch considers relatively low. The free cash flow margin in 2024 was 30.7% after accounting for capital expenditures and dividends.
The rating agency noted that MSCI maintains a 3.0x-3.5x gross leverage target, which aligns with Fitch’s data and analytic processing ’BBB-’ leverage threshold. The company’s leverage has remained below 3.0x for the past two years, partly because MSCI has not issued new debt amid market volatility and higher interest rates.
Fitch expects MSCI will continue to access debt markets opportunistically to optimize its capital structure while maintaining leverage within its target range.
One factor constraining the ratings is MSCI’s customer concentration. BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), Inc. accounted for 10.3%, 9.8%, and 10.2% of MSCI’s revenue over the past three years. While this strategic relationship with the world’s largest ETF provider positions MSCI well to develop products meeting market demands, such dependence on a key client concentrates exposure to self-indexing and competitive risk.
MSCI’s index offerings compete directly with S&P Down Jones Indices,FTSERussell, and other providers of proprietary indexes. Its analytics business competes with subsidiaries of Deutsche Borse Group, BlackRock, Bloomberg Finance, and FactSet Research Systems. The sustainability business competes with Morningstar and Institutional Shareholder Services.
Fitch’s key assumptions include organic revenue growth of 9% decreasing slowly over the next four or five years, EBITDA margins held constant around 60%, dividends increasing in line with absolute EBITDA growth, and free cash flow after dividends being used for stock repurchases in later years.
Factors that could lead to a downgrade include sustained EBITDA leverage above 3.5x, (CFO-capex)/debt sustained below 15%, material reduction in growth rates or margins, or a shift to a more aggressive financial policy.
For a potential upgrade, MSCI would need to maintain EBITDA leverage below 3.0x, (CFO-capex)/debt above 25%, recurring subscription-based run rate fees at 80% of revenue or higher, largest customers representing between 5%-10% of total revenue, and a more conservative financial policy.

Starbucks to roll out AI assistant in stores to speed up service - CNBC,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/starbucks-to-roll-out-ai-assistant-in-stores-to-speed-up-service--cnbc-93CH-4089585,"Investing.com -- Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) plans to introduce a generative AI assistant in 35 locations this month as part of its strategy to make baristas’ jobs easier and improve service speed in its cafes, according to a report from CNBC.
The coffee chain showcased the new technology, created with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure’s OpenAI platform, to over 14,000 North American store managers at its Leadership Experience in Las Vegas on Tuesday. The company intends to launch the ""Green Dot (NYSE:GDOT) Assist"" platform broadly across the U.S. and Canada in fiscal 2026, which begins this fall.
This three-day event comes as Starbucks works to improve its slow U.S. sales and ""get back to Starbucks,"" as CEO Brian Niccol has described the effort since taking the position last year. Niccol aims to reduce service times to four minutes per order, and the AI assistant could help achieve this goal by providing quick, accurate answers to barista questions.
The AI initiative is part of Starbucks’ broader turnaround plans to simplify operations and enhance customer service efficiency in its cafes.

"Brazil bank chiefs balk at tax hike proposal, urge spending review",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/brazil-bank-chiefs-balk-at-tax-hike-proposal-urge-spending-review-4089596,"By Isabel Teles
SAO PAULO (Reuters) -The chief executives of some of Brazil's largest banks on Tuesday expressed concerns over government plans to raise taxes to meet the federal fiscal target, advocating instead for a review of public spending.
The proposed fiscal measures, which President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has yet to formally receive, include higher taxes on online betting, private credit instruments and financial institutions, while trimming a tax hike on the IOF financial transaction tax.
The government raised the IOF tax last month by decree, sparking backlash from Congress and the market.
Roberto Sallouti, CEO of investment bank BTG Pactual, said at an event hosted by banking federation Febraban in Sao Paulo that focusing on spending efficiency would be preferable to tax increases, which he argued would harm economic growth.
""Isn't it time to seek greater efficiency in Brazil's public budget spending?"" Sallouti said, warning that increasing taxes would increase the cost of doing business in the nation.
Lula's administration has so far avoided putting spending cuts on the agenda and defended allocations toward sweeping benefits programs.
Marcelo Noronha, CEO of lender Bradesco, told the same panel that fiscal balance should be achieved through expenditure cuts, not revenue increases, and called for dialogue with policymakers.
Santander (BME:SAN) Brasil CEO Mario Leao acknowledged the difficulty of such decisions but stressed their necessity. ""No one wakes up wanting to pay more in taxes, no one wakes up wanting to manage spending proactively, but these are agendas that Brazil has to face,"" Leao said.",SAN (https://www.investing.com/equities/banco-santander); BBDC4 (https://www.investing.com/equities/bradesco-pn-n1); SAN (https://www.investing.com/equities/banco-santander?cid=32212); BPAC3 (https://www.investing.com/equities/banco-btg-pactual),,,

Duolingo stock falls after Apple announces live translation feature,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/duolingo-stock-falls-after-apple-announces-live-translation-feature-93CH-4089566,"Investing.com --DuolingoInc (NASDAQ:DUOL) shares dropped 2.5% following Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) announcement of a new Live Translation feature powered by Apple Intelligence.
The language learning app's stock declined after Apple revealed the translation capability during its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) 2025 event on Monday. The new feature will be integrated into Messages, FaceTime, and Phone calls on Apple devices.
Leslie Ikemoto, Apple's director of input experience, explained during the presentation that ""Live translation can translate conversation on the fly."" The technology will automatically translate text messages as users type, delivering content in their preferred language, while also translating incoming messages instantly.
For FaceTime calls, the feature will provide live captions of translated speech. During regular phone calls, users' words can be translated in real-time and spoken aloud for recipients, regardless of whether they're using an Apple device. The recipient's responses will similarly be translated back to the caller's language.
The market reaction suggests investors may be concerned about potential competition for Duolingo's language learning services from Apple's new built-in translation capabilities across its ecosystem of devices.

The four-year-old company is currently constructing what will be the world's largest green steel production facility in northern Sweden. Stegra AB has already raised approximately €6.5 billion ($7.4 billion) in funding, with one-third coming from equity and two-thirds from debt financing.
The majority of this capital will be allocated to completing the plant construction and initiating operations. The facility is scheduled to begin steel production by the end of 2026, with an initial annual capacity of 2.5 million tons.
Stegra AB is also planning a second phase of development that would double its production capacity. This expansion would require additional substantial funding, which has prompted the company to begin preliminary work toward a public listing.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) -Brazilian businessman Nelson Tanure has begun talks with the banks that will be key to his bid for petrochemical firmBraskem(NYSE:BAK) , he told Reuters, as he aims to clinch a deal this year and give oil giant Petrobras a larger role in operations.
Braskem is Latin America's largest petrochemical firm, and its controlling shareholder Novonor has been exploring a sale for years as it looks to exit bankruptcy protection and turn the page on a vast corruption scandal.
Tanure is the latest bidder trying to unlock a stalemate between Novonor, the banks holding Braskem shares as collateral and state-run Petrobras, which is an influential shareholder and key supplier of the firm.
In his first public comments since revealing his Braskem bid last month, Tanure said he began courting engineering group Novonor, formerly known as Odebrecht, after the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company's offer to buy its Braskem stake collapsed over a year ago.
""After Adnoc withdrew their offer, I began confidential discussions with (Novonor) in absolute secrecy,"" Tanure wrote in response to questions.
Novonor would remain a shareholder in the proposed deal, Tanure said, with the latest proposal reducing its stake from 38.3% to around 3.5%, adding: ""I would not make an agreement if they did not remain involved.""
Tanure said the deal is still under discussion. Novonor confirmed the talks in May, but declined to comment on details provided by Tanure.
During the corruption scandal a decade ago, Novonor used its Braskem stake as collateral for some 15 billion reais ($2.7 billion) in bank loans. The shares' value has fallen with profit margins in petrochemical markets and now covers less than a quarter of that debt.
Despite Tanure's progress with Novonor, its creditors view his offer with skepticism as they have their own plans for Braskem, according to two people familiar with the matter.
State development bank BNDES and other major banks have proposed pooling the shares pledged as collateral into a private equity fund that would make investments to turn the company around before selling the shares, Reuters reported in November.
BNDES President Aloizio Mercadante confirmed talks with Petrobras and other banks to resolve the standoff at the time. On Tuesday, the bank declined to comment on Tanure's competing proposal to Novonor.
""The success of this acquisition necessarily depends on alignment with (the banks),"" Tanure said, although he pushed back at the idea that the lenders effectively control Braskem.
""It's important to clarify that the shares still belong to the Novonor group. They are merely pledged to banks as collateral for loans.""
The Rio de Janeiro-based businessman, who has a track record of investing in companies undergoing contentious restructuring, is a major shareholder in power firm Light and oil company Prio.
If he can clinch the deal for Braskem, Tanure sees a larger role for Petrobras, which has a right of first refusal for Novonor's stake under their shareholder agreement.
""I believe their presence in (Braskem's) operations is small and needs to be expanded,"" Tanure said. ""We must acknowledge that Petrobras has seniority and management expertise in oil companies comparable to the best in the world.""
Petrobras declined to comment. Last week, Petrobras CEO Magda Chambriard said Braskem was a very important asset, but its current management was ""not what we want."" Asked by Reuters about Tanure's offer, she said: ""We can only applaud. We want a solution.""
Tanure said his ambitions for Braskem include transforming its Camaçari complex in Bahia state into a hub for sustainable innovation and ""green"" petrochemicals with lower emissions.

Novonor would remain a shareholder in the proposed deal, Tanure said, with the latest proposal reducing its stake from 38.3% to around 3.5%, adding: ""I would not make an agreement if they did not remain involved.""
Tanure said the deal is still under discussion. Novonor confirmed the talks in May, but declined to comment on details provided by Tanure.
During the corruption scandal a decade ago, Novonor used its Braskem stake as collateral for some 15 billion reais ($2.7 billion) in bank loans. The shares' value has fallen with profit margins in petrochemical markets and now covers less than a quarter of that debt.
Despite Tanure's progress with Novonor, its creditors view his offer with skepticism as they have their own plans for Braskem, according to two people familiar with the matter.
State development bank BNDES and other major banks have proposed pooling the shares pledged as collateral into a private equity fund that would make investments to turn the company around before selling the shares, Reuters reported in November.
BNDES President Aloizio Mercadante confirmed talks with Petrobras and other banks to resolve the standoff at the time. On Tuesday, the bank declined to comment on Tanure's competing proposal to Novonor.
""The success of this acquisition necessarily depends on alignment with (the banks),"" Tanure said, although he pushed back at the idea that the lenders effectively control Braskem.
""It's important to clarify that the shares still belong to the Novonor group. They are merely pledged to banks as collateral for loans.""
The Rio de Janeiro-based businessman, who has a track record of investing in companies undergoing contentious restructuring, is a major shareholder in power firm Light and oil company Prio.
If he can clinch the deal for Braskem, Tanure sees a larger role for Petrobras, which has a right of first refusal for Novonor's stake under their shareholder agreement.
""I believe their presence in (Braskem's) operations is small and needs to be expanded,"" Tanure said. ""We must acknowledge that Petrobras has seniority and management expertise in oil companies comparable to the best in the world.""
Petrobras declined to comment. Last week, Petrobras CEO Magda Chambriard said Braskem was a very important asset, but its current management was ""not what we want."" Asked by Reuters about Tanure's offer, she said: ""We can only applaud. We want a solution.""
Tanure said his ambitions for Braskem include transforming its Camaçari complex in Bahia state into a hub for sustainable innovation and ""green"" petrochemicals with lower emissions.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) -Brazilian businessman Nelson Tanure has begun talks with the banks that will be key to his bid for petrochemical firmBraskem(NYSE:BAK) , he told Reuters, as he aims to clinch a deal this year and give oil giant Petrobras a larger role in operations.
Braskem is Latin America's largest petrochemical firm, and its controlling shareholder Novonor has been exploring a sale for years as it looks to exit bankruptcy protection and turn the page on a vast corruption scandal.
Tanure is the latest bidder trying to unlock a stalemate between Novonor, the banks holding Braskem shares as collateral and state-run Petrobras, which is an influential shareholder and key supplier of the firm.

The entertainment and dining venue operator posted adjusted earnings per share of $0.76 for the quarter ended May 6, missing the consensus estimate of $1.01. Revenue came in at $567.7 million, below expectations of $573.25 million and down 3.5% from $588.1 million in the same period last year.
Comparable store sales decreased 8.3% compared to the first quarter of 2024. The company attributed the decline to ""clear mistakes"" in marketing, menu, operations and other areas that it is now working to address.
""While performance in the first quarter was nowhere close to where we want and expect to be, our back to basics strategy is working and is driving a material recovery in our top-line trajectory,"" said Kevin Sheehan, Board Chair and Interim Chief Executive Officer.
Dave & Buster's said it has seen sequential improvement in comparable store sales since February, with the trend improving to a 2.2% decline so far in the second quarter.

(Reuters) -TheS&P 500ended higher on Tuesday, lifted by a rally in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) as investors bet on positive results from U.S.-China trade talks aimed at defusing a tariff dispute that has roiled global markets this year.
Wall Street expects improved trade terms after relief from a preliminary deal struck last month was overshadowed by Washington's allegations that Beijing was blocking exports of rare earth minerals critical to the aerospace, semiconductor and defense sectors.
U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the trade talks were going well and he hoped they would end on Tuesday night, but said they could run into Wednesday.
The U.S. stock market has surged in recent weeks, recovering from an April slump sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump's ""Liberation Day"" sweeping global tariffs.
With investors betting the United States will reach trade agreements that reduce Trump's steep trade barriers, the S&P 500 is now trading just below its February record highs.
""The expectation is that they'll figure this out, and that the Liberation Day tariff levels are never going to be seen. You can't get to market valuations where we've got them and have those tariff levels get anywhere close to reality,"" said Scott Ladner, chief investment officer at Horizon Investments.
Shares of Wall Street's most valuable companies were mixed. Tesla rose while Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) slipped.
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) climbed after Reuters reported that OpenAI plans to add Alphabet's Google cloud service to meet its growing needs for computing capacity.
According to preliminary data, the S&P 500 gained 33.95 points, or 0.57%, to end at 6,039.83 points, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 125.00 points, or 0.64%, to 19,717.33. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 119.44 points, or 0.28%, to 42,881.20.

"Brazil bank chiefs balk at tax hike proposal, urge spending review",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/brazil-bank-chiefs-balk-at-tax-hike-proposal-urge-spending-review-4089596,"By Isabel Teles
SAO PAULO (Reuters) -The chief executives of some of Brazil's largest banks on Tuesday expressed concerns over government plans to raise taxes to meet the federal fiscal target, advocating instead for a review of public spending.
The proposed fiscal measures, which President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has yet to formally receive, include higher taxes on online betting, private credit instruments and financial institutions, while trimming a tax hike on the IOF financial transaction tax.
The government raised the IOF tax last month by decree, sparking backlash from Congress and the market.
Roberto Sallouti, CEO of investment bank BTG Pactual, said at an event hosted by banking federation Febraban in Sao Paulo that focusing on spending efficiency would be preferable to tax increases, which he argued would harm economic growth.
""Isn't it time to seek greater efficiency in Brazil's public budget spending?"" Sallouti said, warning that increasing taxes would increase the cost of doing business in the nation.
Lula's administration has so far avoided putting spending cuts on the agenda and defended allocations toward sweeping benefits programs.
Marcelo Noronha, CEO of lender Bradesco, told the same panel that fiscal balance should be achieved through expenditure cuts, not revenue increases, and called for dialogue with policymakers.
Santander (BME:SAN) Brasil CEO Mario Leao acknowledged the difficulty of such decisions but stressed their necessity. ""No one wakes up wanting to pay more in taxes, no one wakes up wanting to manage spending proactively, but these are agendas that Brazil has to face,"" Leao said.",SAN (https://www.investing.com/equities/banco-santander); BBDC4 (https://www.investing.com/equities/bradesco-pn-n1); SAN (https://www.investing.com/equities/banco-santander?cid=32212); BPAC3 (https://www.investing.com/equities/banco-btg-pactual),,,

""I wouldn't expect large growth on the consumer side in any way, potentially even a net decline,"" Santomassimo told investors at a conference. He said it was a bit more difficult to predict growth in commercial loans, given uncertainty over U.S. tariff policies.
Santomassimo spoke days after the Federal Reserve released Wells Fargo from a seven-year, $1.95 trillion cap on its assets imposed as a punishment in the wake of the bank's fake accounts scandal.
Wells Fargo plans to focus on growing most of its businesses, including credit cards, investment banking, wealth management and commercial banking, CEO Charlie Scharf told Reuters in an interview last week.
Industry leaders have praised the banks for its efforts.
""Wells Fargo went through a long, arduous road to get out of it,"" JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon said at the same conference on Tuesday. ""I think it was grossly unfair for a million different reasons, punishment should fit the crime,"" he said, adding that Wells Fargo has been earning good returns and has ambition.
Dimon has also applauded Scharf, once his protege and a former executive at JPMorgan.
Wells Fargo is also seeing signs of improvement in dealmaking, Santomassimo said.
""We are starting to see a little bit of share growth"" in investment banking, he said. ""We are certainly seeing lots of green shoots in terms of deals that we just wouldn't have been a part of earlier.""
Dealmaking has slowed this year as U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff and fiscal policies roiled markets, fueling economic uncertainty. Still, bank executives have expressed optimism about a resurgence.
Citigroup(NYSE:C)'s head of banking, Vis Raghavan, told the same conference that discussions for mergers and acquisitions continue to be ""super active.""",C (https://www.investing.com/equities/citigroup); JPM (https://www.investing.com/equities/jp-morgan-chase); WFC (https://www.investing.com/equities/wells-fargo),,,
Moelis CEO-designate joins Wall Street in signaling dealmaking rebound after tariff pause,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/moelis-ceodesignate-joins-wall-street-in-signaling-dealmaking-rebound-after-tariff-pause-4089590,"By Manya Saini
(Reuters) -Moelis' incoming CEO Navid Mahmoodzadegan told investors on Tuesday that he is optimistic about the dealmaking environment, as confidence returns following a pause in April triggered by U.S. tariff threats.
""I'm optimistic. It definitely feels better and better each day ... The announcement in April, I think set us back a little bit in terms of the M&A environment,"" he said at the Morgan Stanley U.S.FinancialsConference.
Investor sentiment soured and stock markets slid after U.S. President Donald Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariff threats, stalling risk appetite and slowing deal activity.
Appetite for deals has since returned, with market participants and bankers once again seeing an opening for initial public offerings and signs of a pickup in M&A activity.
""Everywhere I go, people want to transact. They want to lean into transactions, whether it's companies or private equity firms or capital providers,"" Mahmoodzadegan said. ""We're seeing our clients push us to launch transactions, even if the environment isn't crystal clear.""
Earlier this week, Moelis (NYSE:MC) said Ken Moelis would step down as CEO of the investment bank and hand the reins to Mahmoodzadegan, its co-founder and co-president.
The succession marks a major step for the bank, which has been led solely by Ken Moelis since its founding in 2007.
While succession at companies closely tied to founding CEOs can be challenging due to their outsized personal influence, Mahmoodzadegan said it was part of the ""natural evolution of the firm.""
""I think Ken felt that even though he's fully active and will continue to be fully active with clients going forward ... this was a great opportunity at a great time to give more responsibility, not just to me, but to the next generation of bankers,"" Mahmoodzadegan added.
The bank's deal pipeline currently is up from April and is as high as ""it's ever been at the firm, or close to it,"" the CEO-designate said.
The comments echo Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick's expectation of a strong end of the quarter for the bank as dealmaking and the calendar for equity capital markets are picking up.
Last week, top executives at the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq also said the IPO market is gaining momentum despite the Trump administration's rapidly shifting tariff policy, adding to the industry's optimism about a meaningful recovery.",NDAQ (https://www.investing.com/equities/nasdaq-omx-group); MS (https://www.investing.com/equities/morgan-stanley); IFNC (https://www.investing.com/indices/financials); MC (https://www.investing.com/equities/moelis---co),,,
"Trump reports more than $600 million in income from crypto, golf, licensing fees",https://www.investing.com/news/forex-news/trump-reports-tens-of-millions-in-income-from-crypto-ventures-4095890,"By Tom Bergin, Lawrence Delevingne and Tom Lasseter
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Donald Trump reported more than $600 million in income from crypto, golf clubs, licensing and other ventures in a public financial disclosure report released on Friday that provided a glimpse of the vast business holdings of America's billionaire president.
The annual financial disclosure form, which appeared to cover the 2024 calendar year, shows the president's push into crypto added substantially to his wealth but he also reported large fees from developments and revenues from his other businesses. Overall, the president reported assets worth at least $1.6 billion, a Reuters calculation shows.
While Trump has said he has put his businesses into a trust managed by his children, the disclosures show how income from those sources still ultimately accrue to the president - something that has opened him to accusations of conflicts of interest.
Some of his businesses in areas such as crypto, for example, benefit from U.S. policy shifts under him and have become a source of criticism.
“President Trump, Vice President Vance, and senior White House staff have completed required ethics briefings and financial reporting obligations,"" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in an emailed statement to Reuters. ""The Trump Administration is committed to transparency and accessibility for the American people.""
The financial disclosure was signed on June 13 and did not state the time period it covered. The details of the cryptocurrency listings, as well as other information in the disclosure, suggest it was through the end of December 2024, which would exclude most of the money raised by the family's cryptocurrency ventures.
Given the speed at which the Trump family has made deals during his ascent to the presidency, the filing is already a time capsule of sorts, capturing a period when the family was just starting to get into crypto but was largely still in the world of real estate deals and golf clubs.
A meme coin released earlier this year by the president - $TRUMP - alone has earned an estimated $320 million in fees, although it's not publicly known how that amount has been divided between a Trump-controlled entity and its partners.
In addition to the meme coin fees, the Trump family has raked in more than $400 million from World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance company. The Trump family is involved, also, with a bitcoin mining operation and digital asset exchange-traded funds.
In the disclosures, Trump reported $57.35 million from token sales at World Liberty. He also reported holding 15.75 billion governance tokens in the venture.
TRUMP MEDIA
The wealth of the Republican businessman-turned-politician ranges from crypto to real estate, and a large part on paper is tied up in his stake in Trump Media & Technology Group, owner of social media platform Truth Social.
Besides assets and revenues from his business ventures, the president reported at least $12 million in income, including through interest and dividends, from passive investments totaling at least $211 million, a Reuters calculation shows.
His biggest investments were in alternative fund manager Blue Owl Capital Corp and in government bond funds managed byCharles Schwab(NYSE:SCHW) and Invesco.
The disclosure often only gave ranges for the value of his assets and income; Reuters used the lower amount listed, meaning the total value of his assets and income was almost certainly higher.
The disclosure showed income from various assets including Trump's properties in Florida. Trump's three golf-focused resorts in the state - Jupiter, Doral and West Palm Beach - plus his nearby private members' club at Mar-a-Lago generated at least $217.7 million in income, according to the filing.
Trump National Doral, the expansive Miami-area golf hub known for its Blue Monster course, was the family's single largest income source at $110.4 million. The income figures provided are essentially revenues, not net profits after subtracting costs.
The disclosure underlined the global nature of the Trump family business, listing income of $5 million in license fees from a development in Vietnam, $10 million in development fees from a project in India and almost $16 million in licensing fees for a Dubai project.
Trump collected royalty money, also, from a variety of deals - $1.3 million from the Greenwood Bible (its website describes it as ""the only Bible officially endorsed by Lee Greenwood and President Trump""); $2.8 million from Trump Watches, and $2.5 million from Trump Sneakers and Fragrances.
Trump listed $1.16 million in income from his NFTs - digital trading cards in his likeness - while First Lady Melania Trump earned around $216,700 from license fees on her own NFT collection.",SCHW (https://www.investing.com/equities/charles-schwab); WDLF (https://www.investing.com/equities/sew-cal-logo-inc),,,
"Exclusive-Crypto giants set for EU green light amid growing regulatory rift, sources say",https://www.investing.com/news/forex-news/exclusivecrypto-giants-set-for-eu-green-light-amid-growing-regulatory-rift-sources-say-4095592,"By Elizabeth Howcroft and John O'Donnell
PARIS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Two of the world's largest cryptocurrency companies are poised to secure licences granting them access to operate across the European Union, as a rift grows among regulators over the speed and rigour of some countries' approvals, according to sources familiar with the matter.
Under the EU's new Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, which came into force earlier this year, member states can issue licences that allow crypto companies to operate throughout the 27-nation bloc, but some have raised concerns in closed-door meetings about the speed with which licences are being granted, two people familiar with those discussions said, asking not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.
At stake is the oversight of the multi-trillion-dollar crypto industry, which regulators have long warned could facilitate fraud, market instability and illicit financial flows if it is not properly supervised.
MiCA aims to bring crypto under the same regulatory umbrella as traditional finance, but some fear that uneven enforcement could undermine its goals.
Gemini, a crypto trading platform founded by billionaire twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, is on the verge of receiving a licence to operate from Malta, the smallest country in the European Union, two people said.
This follows Malta's earlier approvals of OKX and Crypto.com, granted within weeks of the new regime's introduction.
The pace of Malta's approvals has drawn scrutiny from other national regulators, who meet under the umbrella of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). France's AMF has publicly warned that ESMA's lack of direct authority could lead to a ""regulatory race to the bottom"".
Another senior regulatory official, who did not wish to be identified, said that they were concerned about accepting licences granted in countries where regulators had fewer staff, citing Malta as one example.
ESMA has scrutinized Malta's licensing process, with a report due to be circulated in the near future, said one of those people.
A spokesperson for the Malta Financial Services Authority said it had granted four crypto licences so far and was able to move fast due to its past experience, adding that ""expedited processing"" was due to its ""in-depth understanding acquired over these years"".
It said its local money laundering standards were strict. ESMA declined to comment.
OKX said its application was ""rigorous"" and that compliance was a priority.
SELF INTEREST?
The regulatory debate has intensified with expectations that Luxembourg will soon grant a licence to Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN), the first U.S. crypto-focused company to join theS&P 500, one of the people said.
While the application has been in progress for several months, one person pointed to the relatively modest size of Coinbase's planned operation in Luxembourg.
A Coinbase spokesperson did not comment on its application but said it employed 200 in Europe and that it invested in staff to ensure operations were safe.
The spokesperson said Luxembourg was a ""high-bar, well respected global financial centre"" and that Coinbase would hire more than 20 people there by the end of the year.
Luxembourg's financial watchdog declined to comment.
One person familiar with Luxembourg's thinking dismissed any suggestion that the country was lax and said some critics were rather motivated by self interest in a race to attract crypto firms.
Coinbase's anticipated approval is seen as a setback for Ireland, where relations with the crypto industry have cooled. In 2023, Central Bank Governor Gabriel Makhlouf compared crypto to a Ponzi scheme, warning that “most of the time when you gamble, you're actually losing.”
The global cryptocurrency market is currently valued at roughly $3.3 trillion but it has seen crises, such as the collapse and fraud of top U.S. exchange FTX in 2022.
The European Union has long had to contend with divergence between its members.
The dispute is unfolding as European politicians consider granting greater powers to regulator ESMA.
While the European Union is united as a trading bloc and writes much regulation centrally in Brussels, countries vie with each other to attract international businesses.
ESMA head Verena Ross has also pushed publicly for more powers to oversee crypto, although one person familiar with discussions among EU politicians said several countries were sceptical.",US500 (https://www.investing.com/indices/us-spx-500); 0174 (https://www.investing.com/equities/gemini-investments-holdings-ltd); OX Fina US Dollar (https://www.investing.com/crypto/ox-fina/ox-usd); COIN (https://www.investing.com/equities/coinbase-global),,,
"Swedish krona likely to outperform Norwegian krone, BofA says",https://www.investing.com/news/forex-news/swedish-krona-likely-to-outperform-norwegian-krone-bofa-says-93CH-4095025,"Investing.com -- Bank of America expects limited foreign exchange impact from next week's central bank meetings, with modest downside risks for the Norwegian krone against the Swedish krona.
The bank maintains a constructive outlook on both Nordic currencies for the remainder of the year but currently favors the Swedish krona over the Norwegian krone in the near term.
Both currencies, particularly the Swedish krona, are positioned to benefit from Europe's fiscal initiatives and potential rotation into domestic assets, according to Bank of America. An important factor that could support both currencies is the possibility of higher equity hedging ratios among local asset managers.
The bank notes that the Swedish and Norwegian currencies may gain strength from relatively tighter monetary policies compared to the European Central Bank. Additionally, both Nordic economies are expected to experience faster growth than the broader Euro area.
Current market positioning for both currencies remains light, with particularly sparse positioning in the Swedish krona. This positioning dynamic could provide room for appreciation as investors potentially increase their exposure to these Nordic currencies.
Bank of America's analysis suggests both currencies have positive outlooks despite the modest near-term risks associated with upcoming central bank meetings. The bank's preference for the Swedish krona over the Norwegian krone indicates its stronger potential for appreciation in the immediate future.

Market confidence in short U.S. dollar positions intact - BofA,https://www.investing.com/news/forex-news/market-confidence-in-short-us-dollar-positions-intact--bofa-4094605,"Investing.com - Short positions in the U.S. dollar are perceived as the most crowded trade, according to a survey conducted by Bank of America Securities, but conviction in being short the U.S. currency remains largely intact.
Survey respondents remain ambivalent on U.S. duration versus Europe, the U.S. bank said, and especially versus recent history, but they do not hesitate to extend their U.S. dollar short positions, even with short dollar positions clearly perceived as the most crowded trade.
However, dollar positioning continues to lag bearish sentiment, with short U.S. dollar positions remaining this year's highest conviction trade.
This is consistent with survey respondents anticipating trade uncertainty to stabilize at high levels and U.S. exceptionalism to fade, and many preferring to lower their effectively unhedged U.S. asset exposure.
Growing U.S. fiscal concerns could add more pressure on the U.S. dollar, the survey said, and so perhaps could - the not particularly high - fiscal hopes in Europe.
Survey participants believe fiscal concerns in the US have been the biggest driver of recent curve steepening globally, with most survey respondents believing it will take a long-end rate move of greater than 50 bps to generate a shift in U.S. politics towards fiscal discipline.
But U.S. data resilience could still save the day for the U.S. dollar, said Bank of America Securities.",Global Dollar US Dollar (https://www.investing.com/crypto/global-dollar-usdg/usdg-usd),Peter Nurse,,
BRL to continue benefiting from high interest rate differential: UBS,https://www.investing.com/news/forex-news/brl-to-continue-benefiting-from-high-interest-rate-differential-ubs-93CH-4094508,"Investing.com -- Brazil's inflation rate eased more than expected in May, reaching 5.32% year-over-year compared to the consensus forecast of 5.39%. The better-than-anticipated inflation reading suggests the country's monetary tightening cycle may be approaching its conclusion.
Inflation forecasts for 2025 have declined slightly, helped by moderating food prices across the country. Despite the improvement, current inflation remains above Brazil's target band of 1.5-4.5%, keeping pressure on policymakers to maintain restrictive monetary conditions.
The Brazilian central bank currently views its policy stance as highly restrictive, with the benchmark interest rate standing at 14.75%. UBS analysts believe the tightening cycle is nearly complete, with any additional rate hike at next week's meeting likely to be the last in the current series.
Policymakers will likely want to see inflation move closer to the midpoint of their target range before considering rate cuts, according to market observers. The central bank's cautious approach reflects its commitment to bringing inflation firmly under control.
The Brazilian real (BRL) should continue benefiting from its high interest rate differential against other currencies and from broad U.S. dollar weakness. Investors should remain aware of lingering fiscal uncertainties that could affect the currency's performance.
